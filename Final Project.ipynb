    "# Final Project\n",
    "\n",
    "The final project is an exploration _and implementation_ of a numerical algorithm of your choice. Typically this will be algorithm that we did not cover in class or an extended/improved version of an algorithm that we did cover, although these are not the only choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have considerable leeway in choosing a topic of interest to you and structuring your report in a way that is appropriate for the topic you choose, but your project  must incorporate all of the following elements:\n",
    " \n",
    "- Some discussion of the origins and history of the algorithm you discuss. Who invented (or discovered) it, when, and what was the original motivation for the invention or discovery?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A technical mathematical discussion of the theoretical underpinnings of the algorithm. The level of rigor here should be roughly commensurate with the style of the lecture notes: You do not need to provide fully rigorous proofs of every statement, but the presentation should follow a solid logical sequence in which one idea flows from the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An implementation, in any programming language you like, of some version of the algorithm you discuss. This does not have to be a sophisticated code suitable for use in cutting-edge research, and it does not have to be optimized for efficiency — in fact, it can be a fairly simpleminded implementation — but it must be capable of generating at least some results relevant for the problem at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Results (including plots) showing the performance of your implementation, and (where possible) comparing it against other implementations.\n",
    " \n",
    "A rough guideline for the magnitude of the writeup is that it should consist of 10-15 $\\LaTeX$ pages (including plots but not including code listings).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The final project proposal \n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting started on your final project, you must submit a brief _proposal_ to let me know what you are planning\n",
    "to do and how you envision structuring your final report. This proposal is due by ** November 4, 2016 ** (you may email it to me directly or submit it in class). Below is a rough sample of what a reasonable proposal might \n",
    "look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ** Practical Evaluation of Lattice Sums: Is Ewald Summation\n",
    "> Always Best? **\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Many problems in computational science require efficient\n",
    "and accurate evaluation of _lattice sums_ — that\n",
    "is, sums that accumulate contributions to some physical\n",
    "quantity from sites in a one-, two-, or three-dimensional\n",
    "lattice. Brute-force evaluation of such sums is generally \n",
    "prohibitively expensive, and this fact has spurred the \n",
    "development of more sophisticated and efficient methods. \n",
    "In class we covered one such method — _Ewald summation_ — but\n",
    "we discussed only the electrostatic (zero-frequency) case, \n",
    "and then only for the cases of one- and two-dimensional \n",
    "lattices.  My final project will extend this discussion\n",
    "to a broader comparison of lattice-summation methods,\n",
    "including consideration of three-dimensional lattices\n",
    "and nonzero-frequency problems.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">My paper will begin with a brief introduction (2—4\n",
    "pages) to the problem. I will then discuss (3—5 pages) \n",
    "the history of lattice-summation methods, touching in \n",
    "particular on the original contributions of Paul Ewald \n",
    "himself and the physical problems that motivated\n",
    "his development of the Ewald-summation technique,\n",
    "but considering also the evolution of techniques\n",
    "spurred by the computer-aided-design (CAD) revolution\n",
    "of the late 20th century.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Then I will explain (5-8 pages) the mathematical \n",
    "underpinnings of several sophisticated lattice-summation\n",
    "methods, including **(1)** Ewald summation, \n",
    "**(2)** Kummer decomposition, and \n",
    "**(3)** integral transforms.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Finally, for the specific problem of a 2D lattice sum\n",
    "at nonzero frequency I will implement Ewald summation \n",
    "and Kummer decomposition and compare (3—5 pages) \n",
    "the accuracy and efficiency of these two methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the final project is graded\n",
    "\n",
    "Your most important task in the final project is to get your implementation of the algorithm(s) working\n",
    "and produce convincing numerical results (plots, data tables, etc.) that demonstrate that your implementation is\n",
    "successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thorough discussions of background, theory, and implementation are also important, but even the \n",
    "most thorough treatment of these topics will not compensate for incomplete implementation or a failure to report\n",
    "results produced by your original implementation. \n",
    "\n",
    "A rough grading rubric for the final project looks something like this. \n",

    "## Some Possible Final Projects\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a number of possible final-project topics, with content spanning a variety of interesting calculations \n",
    "arising in various subfields mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Needless to say, this is <i>not</i> intended to be an exhaustive list, and in no way are you required to\n",
    "choose one of these topics for your project. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Numerical Linear Algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Conjugate Gradient Methods for Linear Systems.** Implement the Conjugate Gradient method and test it against other iterative or direct methods on an example problem.\n",
    "- **Fast Fourier Transform.** Implement a recursive Fast Fourier Transform in Julia, and test your code against the direct method. Test your code against FFTW, a standard implementation in C. An in-depth reference is Van Loan, “Computational Frameworks for the Fast Fourier Transform.”\n",
    "- **The Power Method and Google PageRank.** Implement the power method for finding the leading eigenvector of a matrix. Read and discuss the survey paper “Deeper Inside PageRank” by Langville and Meyer. (This project requires some familiarity with probability and Markov chains.)\n",
    "- **K-means clustering via SVD.**  Consider the problem of clustering data into $k$ clusters using the singular value decomposition.\n",
    "- **Topic modeling.**  Topic modelling aims to learn the thematic structure of a text corpus automatically.  Possible implementation could be to automatically add metatag data to tweets.\n",
    "- **Collaborative Filtering.**  Investigate a recommendation system, which is based on the SVD of sparse matrices.  Illustrate how they complete the recommendation matrix, implement a toy example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multivariate statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Research Principal Components Analysis, and show how it can be used to do multivariate regression and dimension reduction.  If you're eager, look into \"Sparse PCA\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chaos in Dynamical Systems: Lorenz Attractor. \n",
    "\n",
    "Look up the Lorenz Attractor in two or more hard references (books or journal articles.) Use an ODE method to model the system of equations. Change the parameters of the system to display the transition to chaos, and reproduce the “butterfly effect.”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computer science / cryptography\n",
    "\n",
    "Research the Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovasz (LLL) lattice-basis reduction algorithm and its use in proving the fundamental insecurity of knapsack cryptography. You may either **(1)** write your own simple implementation of the LLL algorithm and evaluate its performance on some relevant test cases, or **(2)** write code that calls a pre-existing implementation of the LLL algorithm to implement the steps an unscrupulous eavesdropper would take to decipher a communication that has been supposedly ``encrypted'' using knapsack cryptography.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some references on the LLL algorithm:\n",

    "Your code should input a height _t_ off the critical line and determine — to arbitrary user-specified accuracy — the location of the nearest zero lying on the critical  line at a height greater than or equal to *t* from the real axis. Use your code to determine the locations of the first 100 nontrivial zeros and compare their spacings to the predictions of random-matrix theory.\n"
